## Hi!

You've stumbled upon my github. I am not good at describing myself, so I will make it brief. I'm someone who can find unbridled passion in just about anything.

My interests are mostly in game-development, and my main obsession has been C++.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Pantry Raid! [Wishlist on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3582510/Pantry_Raid)**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Rust**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Why I'm excited for C++26**
